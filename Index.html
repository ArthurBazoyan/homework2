			<p> 
				Electronic dance music (EDM) is a broad range of percussive 
				electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves
				and festivals. EDM is generally produced for playback by disk jockeys (DJs) 
				who create seamless selections of tracks called a mix,
				by segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also 
				perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in waht 
				is sometimes called a live PA. EDM is more commonly called "dance music" or simlply "dance".
